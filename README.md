Course overwiew: 
During my completion of the Python for Everybody Specialization, I gained knowledge and skills in Python programming and its applications. I acquired a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. Additionally, I developed proficiency in working with data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples, as well as manipulating data using Python.

Furthermore, I learned how to access and extract data from the web using APIs and web scraping techniques, allowing me to retrieve and process data from various online sources. I also gained experience in working with databases, specifically using Structured Query Language (SQL) and Python to interact with and manipulate data within a database.

The specialization's Capstone Project provided me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the courses. I successfully designed and created my own Python application for data retrieval, processing, and visualization, showcasing my abilities in solving real-world programming challenges.

Overall, completing the Python for Everybody Specialization has equipped me with a strong command of Python programming, data handling, and the ability to design and develop applications for data analysis and visualization. These skills make me a valuable asset for roles that involve data processing, software development, and leveraging Python's capabilities for efficient problem-solving.

**Throughout the Python for Everybody Specialization, while completing the assignments and projects, I worked with presented code, modifying and upgrading it based on the given scheme, in order to demonstrate my understanding and application of the concepts taught in the courses.**
